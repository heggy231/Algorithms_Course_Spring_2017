Algorithms Course Spring 2017
-----------------------------
-----------------------------


## Hey everybody,



This is the repo for the peer taught algorithms course at 42 US.

I will be posting lecture notes and video links to all classes here.

You can also ask questions (or, more likely, correct me) using pull requests.

Or you can slack me at csummers if you'd rather!



### Thanks for your interest!



Best,

Charlie Summers
