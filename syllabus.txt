Course Syllabus


Class Hours - 7:00 pm to 8:30 pm Mondays (some days will be shorter/longer, but should be roughly this long)


Dates - Jan 16th to Mar 27th


Textbook - We will be following the book Algorithms by Sanjoy Dasgupta, Christos Papadimitriou and Umesh Vazirani.
           The textbook is not required to participate in the class, but contains additional problems and lots of
		   quality pictures, so I recommend it!
		   Google and wikipedia are definitely sufficient though (as I'm sure you already know).

Organization - This "class" will be pretty relaxed. I hope to be talking < 50% of the time, with the first few
               classes probably requiring more as we get into the swing of things.

			   I haven't ever taught a course in this way before, so I will likely need your watchful eyes to keep
			   track of time and to help bring us back on track should we get pulled off on a tangent for too long.

			   It's also alright if you can't make it every week. I'll not be taking attendance or anything like
			   that. You are expected to do the work necessary to catch up. We won't have time to cover old material
			   during classes.

			   I also know that people will be pulled away by other work and not be able to come for a few weeks.
			   If that's the case, you're of course always welcome to come back! If you find it too hard to keep
			   up due to having missed material, feel free to talk to me outside of class and I'll try to point
			   you in the fastest direction to getting back on track.


Assignments - There will be no required assignments. I will post interesting problems both from our textbook and
              elsewhere for you to work on should you want the additional practice. Some will be coding projects
			  and others will be more math-related.

			  Assignments will not be graded (I still have to find some time for 42 work...) but I'd be happy to
			  chat with you about them!

			  If you have any ideas for cool projects, feel free to share them in our slack channel or (even better)
			  add them to this repo via a pull request!


Expectations - So there are no assignments, does that mean that you don't have to do anything? Of course not!
               The only way for this course to be successful (and for everybody to learn well) is if we push each
			   other hard.

			   I've set an ambitious schedule and I want people to get as much from the course as possible. If this
			   becomes like a course at college - where you just show up and sit there as I talk at you - it will be
			   a pretty awful experience for all of us. I need you to bring enthusiasm and a willingness to learn
			   every week.

			   This is exceptionally important because I am not a professor. I am not an expert. I'll be learning much
			   of this material as I prepare for our classes each week. Because of this, my understanding will not be
			   perfect and, should yours be better, you are welcome (i.e. expected) to teach us what you know.

			   Luckily, we're at the best school in the world and everybody is here to learn. So I have complete
			   faith that we'll all get a ton out of this course.
